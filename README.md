# Assignment-4
Requirements

Situation
You work for a College as their Data Scientist and your job is to help the Professors manage the data that they receive from the College. For this assignment you need to help the Professors of 3 different classes with their student enrollment list. 

The Professors were given a single CSV file that contains a "master list" of all students across all courses. But each Professor only wants to see a list of their own students (not the students who are in other classes).


Job
You will need to parse the Master List File and separate the data into 3 separate CSV files. Each CSV file should contain a list of students specific to that particular course (i.e. we're grouping the students by course). 

For each of the 3 CSV files, you'll need to sort the students by grade in descending order.

The CSV output file names should be called: course1.csv, course2.csv, and course3.csv.


Hints
In order to sort an array, you'll need to figure out how to handle null entries in your array. If you're trying to use Arrays.sort(yourArray), and yourArray contains null values, the sort will crash. 
When writing to a file, you can use "\n" to write a new line to the file. Fore example: fileWriter.write("This is one line \n");
If you want to turn String input into an Integer, you can parse it like so: Integer myIntVal = Integer.parseInt(myStringVal);
